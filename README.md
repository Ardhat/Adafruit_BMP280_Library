#Adafruit BMP280 Driver (Barometric Pressure Sensor) #

This driver is modified for I2C operation only for use with Ardhat (see http://ardhat.com)

## About the BMP280 ##

This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure and temperature. Because pressure changes with altitude you can also use it as an altimeter!
